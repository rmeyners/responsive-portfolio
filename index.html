      <p>Oh hello&#33; Didn&#39;t see you there, welcome to my basic portfolio. My name is Robert Meyners. Let me take this opportunity to tell you a little about myself, and how I got to this point. Originally from the ivy league town of Princeton, NJ, I was a spry young fellow destined for greatness. Then reality set it, and well, I am just your &#34;average joe&#34; with aspirations of family and building something for myself. After graduating &#40;not from Princeton University&#41; with a Bachelors in Business Administration, with a concentration in Marketing, I took to the tri&#8211;state area to start my career. Being that it was 2010, in the middle of a recession, I was S.O.L. and had to make a pivot&#8230;</p>

      <p> The next few years were plagued with odd jobs, a short stint in L.A.&#39;s film industry, and a big bank. Luckily, after 3 short years, I was introduced to the world of Search Engine Marketing, specifically SEO &#40;search engine optimization&#41;. Ever since then, I have immersed myself into what I believe to be one of the best industries to have a career. I am now enrolled in The Coding Bootcamp full stack program, at the UCSD Extension, looking to further my skills in this ever growing, ever changing, digital world. My ultimate goal is to bridge the gap between SEOs, Developers, and Designers. I believe with skill sets in all fronts, I can be invaluable to any, and all, companies. Maybe i&#39;ll help you&#33;</p>

      <p>Welcome&#33;</p>
